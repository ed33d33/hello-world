# hello-world
I'm a business consultant most interested in app and web development as well as the defensive aspect of cyber security.
I work with entrepreneurs, dreamers, inventors, and innovators around the world, assisting with the realization of their business ideas and aspirations.
By it's very nature, my work is both organic and infinitely variable. The skills and expertise that I have and continue to expand and develop are all centered on helping my clients and serving their best interests.
